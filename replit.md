# Overview

This is an AI-Based Timetable Generation System designed for NEP 2020 compliance, targeting multidisciplinary education structures in higher education institutions. The system consists of a full-stack web application with an integrated AI optimization engine that automatically generates conflict-free, optimized academic timetables for multiple programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP).

The application provides comprehensive management of courses, faculty, rooms, and students while offering real-time conflict detection and resolution. It features role-based dashboards for administrators, faculty, and students, with export capabilities for generated timetables in PDF and Excel formats.
