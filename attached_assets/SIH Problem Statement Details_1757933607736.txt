AI-Based Timetable Generation System (Final Flow)
A. Base Timetable Setup (Admin → System Questions)
Before timetable generation, the Admin configures the base framework:

Slot Configuration

Slot length → 50 min / 55 min (depends on walking distance between blocks, campus infra).

College start & end timings (e.g., 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM).

Number of slots per day (e.g., 7–8).

Breaks/lunch timings.

Credit-to-Slot Mapping

1 credit → 1 slot/week.

2 credits → 2 slots/week.

3 credits → 3 slots/week.

Labs → consecutive slots (2–3 credits).

Course Setup

Upload course list (Major, Minor, Skill-Based, Ability Enhancement, Value-Added).

Define → course code, credits, theory/lab split, student strength.

AI auto-calculates required slots for each course.

Faculty Setup

Assign faculty to courses.

Define availability, workload limits (e.g., max 12 hrs/week).

Specialization check → only qualified faculty can teach.

Room/Lab Setup

Room capacity, location, availability.

Tag rooms/labs to specific courses (e.g., Physics → Physics Lab).

Student strength vs room strength validation.
